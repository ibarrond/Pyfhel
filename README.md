**Pyfhel**: **PY**thon **F**or **H**omomorphic **E**ncryption **L**ibraries.

* **_Version_**: [_v2.3.1_]
* **_Status_**: STABLE
* **_Description_**: Allows ADDITION, SUBSTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, SCALAR PRODUCT over encrypted vectors|scalars of integers|binaries. This library acts as optimized Python API for the most advanced C++ HE libraries.
* **_Language_**: Python (3.5+) & Cython on top of C++17.
* **_OS_**: Windows (tested with `MSVC2017`, `MSVC2019`, and `gcc6` for WSL) and Linux (tested on `gcc6`). MacOS not supported.

	:warning: _REQUIRED: Python must have been compiled with C++17: `g++>=6` | `MSVC 2017+`_ :warning:
	
* **_Docs_**: For now, only the API is documented [[link](https://pyfhel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)]. Examples are heavily commented.
* **_Dependencies_**: There are two possible backends (both shipped alongside Pyfhel), HE libraries in C++:
   
   1. [SEAL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/simple-encrypted-arithmetic-library/) (no external dependencies, default).
   2. [PALISADE](https://git.njit.edu/palisade/PALISADE.git) (no external dependencies) __WIP__
   3. ~~[HElib](https://github.com/shaih/HElib) (depends on [GMP](http://www.gmplib.org) & [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html)) DROPPED~~

## Summary
**PY**thon **F**or **H**omomorphic **E**ncryption **L**ibraries, **Pyfhel** implements functionalities of multiple Homomorphic Encryption libraries such as addition, multiplication, exponentiation or scalar product in Python. **Pyfhel** uses a syntax similar to normal arithmetics (+,-,\*). This library is useful both for simple Homomorphic Encryption Demos as well as for complex problems such as Machine Learning algorithms.

**Pyfhel** is built on top of **Afhel**, an **A**bstraction **H**momorphic **E**ncryption **L**ibraries in C++. **Afhel** serves as common API for all backends. Additionally, this project contains a large series of Demos & Tests for **HElib**(no longer in use), **SEAL**, **Afhel** & **Pyfhel**.

Last but not least, we include Makefiles to compile and install **HElib**, **SEAL** and **Afhel** as shared libraries in Ubuntu, which can then be linked to other C++ programs using the tags `-lhelib`, `-lseal` and `-lafhel`.

## Install & Uninstall
This project has been uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Pyfhel/). In order to install it from source (*WARNING! it takes several minutes to compile, be patient!*), run:

	   > pip install Pyfhel

Locally, you can clone this repository (use [`--recursive`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules) to download all submodules) and install it by running:

	   > git clone --recursive https://github.com/ibarrond/Pyfhel.git
	   > pip install .

To uninstall, just run:
	
	   > pip uninstall Pyfhel
       
### Contribute/Development notice
This is the process to develop/contribute to Pyfhel:
1. _Code a new feature/fix a bug_. Since this project is built using Cython, please refer to [cython documentation](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you want to help develop it.
2. _Recompile the cython extensions_. After modifying any of the `.pyx`|`pxd` cython files (or the _Afhel_ `.cpp` files) you must recompile the cython files. To do so, run the following command:
```bash
# This will turn `Pyfhel/*.pyx` into the corresponding `Pyfhel/*.cpp` file.
#  Do not edit the `Pyfhel/*.cpp` files directly!
> python3 setup.py --CYTHONIZE --fullname
	Compiling Pyfhel/Pyfhel.pyx because it changed.
	Compiling Pyfhel/PyPtxt.pyx because it depends on ./Pyfhel/iostream.pxd.
	[1/2] Cythonizing Pyfhel/Pyfhel.pyx
	[2/2] Cythonizing Pyfhel/PyPtxt.pyx
	Pyfhel-2.0.2
```

3. _Reinstall Pyfhel locally_. Use either `pip install .` or `python3 setup.py build` (for verbose output and fine control. Run `python3 setup.py --help` for further options).

4. _Test changes locally_. Run the `test.py` file in your environment and make sure all tests are OK:

```bash
python3 Pyfhel/test.py
	test_PyCtxt_creation_deletion (__main__.PyfhelTestCase) ... (0.0s) ...ok
	test_PyPtxt_PyCtxt (__main__.PyfhelTestCase) ... (0.0s) ...ok
	[...]
	test_Pyfhel_5d_save_restore_int (__main__.PyfhelTestCase) ... (1.239s) ...ok

	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 29 tests in 11.907s

	OK
```
 
5. _Update the version_. To update it, just change the version number on top of this README: Pyfhel [_vA.B.C_]. Bugfixes and minor corrections should increase _C_. New features should increase _B_. Backwards incompatible changes should increase _A_. 

6. _Optional: Update the docs_. WIP (automatic generation with sphinx).

You're ready to go! Just create a pull request to the original repo.
